### Description

Here is another SUDOKU SOLVER/CREATOR.

This one can solve almost any puzzle, it has 8 different logical solving methods and a guessing mode. It can create 7 different puzzle levels and of course it can solve them (3x3 and 4x4) (the hardest levels need guessing). it can load/save puzzles, give hints, show a log file of how it has solved a puzzle, print puzzles (or complete puzzlebooks) and much more.

There is a complete helpfile in it with al the possibilities so playing with this program should not be a problem.

Thanks for the persons who builded the module INIs.bas and PrintMod.bas so i didn't have to reinvent it again.
